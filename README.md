<h1 align='center'> Hi! :wave:</h1>

I'm Arief, a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist.

I work on cool projects every day. Unfortunately, I cannot share my work-related work here due to the confidentiality nature of the work. However, when I have free time, I enjoy working on things outside my work:

- [`The Elements of Statistical Learning`](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) book is, in my opinion, one of the must-read books if you are a data scientist. It provides thorough mathematical explanations of most of the important machine/statistical learning models. I have been working on deriving some of the algorithms and implementing them from scratch in Python. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/abkoesdw/The-Elements-of-Statistical-Learning-Python-Codes)

- I have been building a python package for retrieving machine learning datasets: [`ml-datasets`](https://github.com/abkoesdw/ml-datasets)
- A python porting of MATLAB code to produce some results in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X17301838)
- More to come ...
